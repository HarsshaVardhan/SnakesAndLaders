Snakes and Ladders Game in LLD🎲🐍🪜  
A simple Snakes and Ladders game implemented in LLD using java, supporting multiple players and using dice rolls to determine movement.  

Low-Level Design (LLD) in Java focuses on defining the detailed structure of a system by breaking it down into classes, methods, and their interactions. It involves applying Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism to create a scalable and maintainable design. LLD also incorporates design patterns like Singleton, Factory, and Observer to improve code reusability and efficiency. Following SOLID principles ensures better code organization, making it easier to modify and extend. Additionally, UML diagrams, such as class and sequence diagrams, help visualize the relationships between components. Exception handling and multi-threading are also crucial in LLD for building robust applications. Overall, LLD bridges the gap between High-Level Design (HLD) and actual implementation, ensuring a well-structured, efficient, and maintainable codebase.
